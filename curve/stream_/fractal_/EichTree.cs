	/// <remarks>
	/// In VLSI(Very Large Scale Integration) design, the H tree may be used as the layout for a complete binary tree using a total area that is proportional to the number of nodes of the tree.
	///
	/// It is commonly used as a clock distribution network for routing timing signals to all parts of a chip with equal propagation delays to each part,[6] and has also been used as an interconnection network for VLSI multiprocessors.[7] For the same reason, the H tree is used in arrays of microstrip antennas in order to get the radio signal to every individual microstrip antenna with equal propagation delay.
