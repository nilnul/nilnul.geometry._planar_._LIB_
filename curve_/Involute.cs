	/// In mathematics, an involute (also known as an evolvent) is a particular type of curve that is dependent on another shape or curve. An involute of a curve is the locus of a point on a piece of taut string as the string is either unwrapped from or wrapped around the curve.
	/// It is a class of curves coming under the roulette family of curves.
	/// The evolute of an involute is the original curve.
