	/// <summary>
	/// 	In mathematics, a Lissajous curve /ˈlɪsəʒuː/, also known as Lissajous figure or Bowditch curve /ˈbaʊdɪtʃ/, is the graph of a system of parametric equations:
	/// 	x = A sin ⁡ ( a t + δ )
	/// 	,
	/// 	y = B sin ⁡ ( b t )
	/// 	,
	/// 	which describe complex harmonic motion.This family of curves was investigated by Nathaniel Bowditch in 1815, and later in more detail by Jules Antoine Lissajous in 1857.
	///The appearance of the figure is highly sensitive to the ratio a/b. For a ratio of 1, the figure is an ellipse, with special cases including circles(A = B, δ =π/2 radians) and lines(δ = 0). Another simple Lissajous figure is the parabola(b/a=2, δ =π/4）。Other ratios produce more complicated curves, which are closed only if a/b is rational.The visual form of these curves is often suggestive of a three-dimensional knot, and indeed many kinds of knots, including those known as Lissajous knots, project to the plane as Lissajous figures.
