	/// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation
	/// In mathematics, bilinear interpolation is an extension of linear interpolation for interpolating functions of two variables (e.g., x and y) on a rectilinear 2D grid.
	/// Bilinear interpolation is performed using linear interpolation first in one direction, and then again in the other direction.Although each step is linear in the sampled values and in the position, the interpolation as a whole is not linear but rather quadratic in the sample location.
