   The "width" of a closed convex curve is defined as the distance between parallel lines bounding it("supporting lines"). 

   Curves of constant width have the same "width" regardless of their orientation between the parallel lines.
   Every curve of constant width is convex.
   In fact, they also share the same perimeter (Barbier's theorem). 
   
		Examples include the circle (with largest area), and Reuleaux triangle (with smallest area) but there are an infinite number. A curve of constant width can be used in a special drill chuck to cut square "holes." 

 A generalization gives solids of constant width.These do not have the same surface area for a given width, but their shadows are curves of constant width with the same width!
