    /// this is the length unit.There are three feet in a yard and 12 inches in a foot.In 1958 the United States and countries of the Commonwealth of Nations defined the length of the international yard to be 0.9144 meters, effective July 1, 1959. Consequently, the international foot is defined to be equal to 0.3048 meters (equivalent to 304.8 millimeters).The international standard symbol for a foot is "ft" (see ISO 31-1, Annex A). In some cases, the foot is denoted by a prime, which is often approximated by an apostrophe, and the inch by a double prime. For example, 2 feet 4 inches is denoted as 2′4″. This use can cause confusion, because the prime and double prime are also international standard symbols for arcminutes and arcseconds.
