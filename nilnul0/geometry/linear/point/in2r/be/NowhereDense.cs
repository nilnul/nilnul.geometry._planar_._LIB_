	/// There exist nowhere dense sets of positive measure. For example, enumerating the rationals in [0,1] as {q_n} and choosing an open interval I_n of length 1/3^n containing q_n for each n, then the union of these intervals has measure at most 1/2. Hence, the set of points in [0,1] but not in any of {I_n} has measure at least 1/2, despite being nowhere dense.
